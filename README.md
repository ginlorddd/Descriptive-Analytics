# Project descriptive analytics of air pollution in Vietnam in 2021
---
## **Introduction**
*Air pollution has emerged as one of the most pressing environmental challenges of the 21st century, posing significant risks to public health, ecosystems, and economies worldwide. In Vietnam, rapid urbanization, industrial expansion, and increased vehicular emissions have contributed to deteriorating air quality, especially in major cities such as Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. Understanding the extent, sources, and seasonal patterns of air pollution is crucial for policymakers, environmental agencies, and the public to implement effective mitigation strategies.

This project, titled "Descriptive Analytics of Air Pollution in Vietnam in 2021," aims to analyze air quality data across various regions of Vietnam throughout the year 2021. By employing descriptive analytics techniques, we seek to uncover key trends, identify pollution hotspots, and explore temporal variations in air quality indicators such as particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ground-level ozone (O3).

The study leverages data from reputable environmental monitoring organizations and government agencies. We apply statistical and visualization methods to present an in-depth overview of air pollution levels, highlighting periods of critical concern and regions most affected. Additionally, the project examines potential correlations between air pollution levels and factors such as weather conditions, population density, and industrial activity.

Through this project, we aim to provide valuable insights into Vietnam's air pollution landscape in 2021, offering a data-driven foundation for future research, policy formulation, and public awareness campaigns aimed at reducing air pollution and improving environmental sustainability.*
